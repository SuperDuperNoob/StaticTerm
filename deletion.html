    <h1>🤝 Data Deletion Request (Let's Figure This Out Together)</h1>

    <div class="intro-box">
        <p>As noted in our Service Usage and Data Non-Policy, this service was primarily for **private, non-commercial use**, and was **not intended to systematically collect user data.**</p>
        <p>Frankly, **we don't have a clear, automated process** because we aren't entirely sure what minimal data, if any, may have been incidentally logged or stored. However, we are happy to work with you to find and delete anything that might exist!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Your Deletion Request</h2>
    <p>If you wish for any data related to your use of this Service to be deleted, please follow these steps:</p>

    <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Email Your Request:</strong> Send an email to the contact address provided below.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify Yourself:</strong> Please clearly state the username, email address, or any other unique identifier you used when interacting with the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Describe the Data (If Possible):</strong> If you know exactly what interaction might have generated data (e.g., "the content I submitted on October 10th"), please include that detail.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Our Shared Process</h2>
    <p>Once we receive your request, our process will look something like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> We will manually search our logs, databases, and backup files for any data associated with your provided identifier.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We will reply to your email, explaining what (if anything) we found and confirm that we have initiated the manual deletion process.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Once the deletion is complete (including from any immediate server logs or backups), we will send you a final confirmation email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Expectation</h2>
    <p>Please understand that due to the ad-hoc nature of this Service, this manual process may take time (potentially several days or weeks). We will do our best to permanently remove any data we can reasonably locate.</p>

    <div class="contact">

    <p><em>Thank you for your patience as we work through this together.</em></p>
